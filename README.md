# UTFSM Masters Thesis Template

As of *26/02/2026* currently the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria's Postgrad Thesis template seems to have been lost after migration to more modern website designs sadly this warmly welcomed change has meant the introduction of a plethora of unwanted issues for many of our fellows master's and phd's students resulting in the loss of meaningful content such as tutorials, guides and templates. In a personal effort to lessen this loss I put in care of the open source community this template, in order to help any other bewildered and confused postgrad's such as I.
